NOTE THAT THESE ROMS WILL NOT WORK ON ANY VERSION OF YUNE PRIOR TO 0.9.2.

If you're reading this, then congrats! You're one step closer to making FE8 Randomized more enjoyable for yourself and anyone watching. Odds are you've obtained this through KeizaCord, but if not, then where the heck did you get this?

Packaged are two different ROMS, labeled Deluxe and SongSwap.

Fogless Deluxe is fogless but with a few quality of life changes.

SongSwap is the same, but has FE7 music.

Anyways, have fun with your new toys. Just shoot me a DM or something if things don't work right or if you have any changes that you would like to be added.

*Note that textual changes make the ROM unrandomizable at the moment. Making shop/armory changes requires substitutions, as adding more slots also makes the ROM unrandomizable.*
