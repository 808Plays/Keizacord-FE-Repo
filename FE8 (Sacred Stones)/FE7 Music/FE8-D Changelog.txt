Disclaimer: Since the ROM now believes that claws are "bows", bow-based units may have these equipped. You have been warned. Also they are not effective against fliers, so don't worry about that.
Also, don't promote units with weapons their promoted classes can't use (e.g. Bonewalker with a lance). Might result in a crash.
