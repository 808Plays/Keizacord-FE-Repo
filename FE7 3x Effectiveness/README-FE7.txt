If you're reading this, then congrats! You're one step closer to making FE7 Randomized more enjoyable for yourself and anyone watching. Odds are you've obtained this through KeizaCord, but if not, then where the heck did you get this?

Packaged is a single ROM, labeled Deluxe Plus.

Deluxe Plus is fogless for the most part but with a few quality of life changes and JP's 3x effectiveness.

Anyways, have fun with your new toy. Just shoot me a DM or something if things don't work right or if you have any changes that you would like to be added.


*Note that textual changes make the ROM unrandomizable at the moment. Making shop/armory changes requires substitutions, as adding more slots also makes the ROM unrandomizable.*
