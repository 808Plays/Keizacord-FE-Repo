Credits for patches:
circleseverywhere - Danger zone
Tequila - Battle stats w/animations off, Staff range fix, Multiple S ranks

Credits for assets:
The Blind Archer - Axe Wyvern Lord

NOTES:
- Removing weather effects from Lyn mode get removed (likely from the tutorial patch), so I'm just...leaving it in I guess.
- Certain changes are only catered towards HHM. Because Eliwood mode isn't as fun.

Known Bug(s):
- With the Staff range fix, the range of ballistas may be added to units attack ranges, even if they can't use a ballista. (This is only graphical, and has no effect on gameplay).
- Resetting the ROM might fuck with magic uses. You have been warned.
