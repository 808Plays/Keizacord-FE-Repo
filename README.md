# GBA-FE-Repo

This is a repository for Fire Emblem related things from Keizaron's discord. Certain versions of things may not be updated unless requested due to a lack of interst. Unless specified, assume that these use a US version of the game.

Anything important is probably going to be in the respective folders. If you need help patching a ROM, or need a program like NUPS, you can refer to [this](https://feuniverse.us/t/how-to-patch-a-rom/4061) guide.

## Contact

If there are any problems, I can typically be found on [Discord](https://discord.gg/keizaron), in the #fire-emblem channel. Make sure you read the rules of the server.
