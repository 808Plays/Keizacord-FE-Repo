Credits for patches:
AuraWolf - Forced Units changing Starting Position
circleseverywhere - Danger zone, Health bars
Tequila - Battle stats w/animations off, Staff range fix, Multiple S ranks, Display growths

Credits for assets:
The Blind Archer - Axe Wyvern Lord
shadowofchaos725 - Nomad Tropoer Close Range animation fix

NOTES:
- Removing weather effects from Lyn mode get removed (likely from the tutorial patch), so I'm just...leaving it in I guess.
- Certain changes are only catered towards HHM. Because Eliwood mode isn't as fun.

Known Bug(s):
- With the Staff range fix, the range of ballistas may be added to units attack ranges, even if they can't use a ballista. (This is only graphical, and has no effect on gameplay).
